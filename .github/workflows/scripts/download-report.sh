# Script for downloading an artifact based on the given RUN_ID and ARTIFACT_NAME.
# Artifacts will be saved on the given DOWNLOAD_PATH.
# GitHub CLI is used to perform the download. Therefore, you'll need to set a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable as mentioned in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/using-github-cli-in-workflows
# 
# To use this script, you should first set these environment variables:
# - RUN_ID
# - ARTIFACT_NAME
# - DOWNLOAD_PATH
# - GITHUB_TOKEN
#

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Attempt download this many times
MAX_ATTEMPTS=10

# Wait time between each download attempt
